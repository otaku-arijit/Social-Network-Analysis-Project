The target here is to make the group buy most products possible. So if you manage to find him/her, you can have maximum profit. In my project I have done the same. I took two data sets:
1. Facebook Dataset
2. Email Dataset

1. First I have detected the communities using **Louvain's Algorithm**
2. Then we run
